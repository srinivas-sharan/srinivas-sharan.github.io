I am an Assistant Professor with a joint appointment in the [Department of Industrial &  Systems Engineering](https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/ise/) and the [Department of Marketing](https://business.missouri.edu/departments-faculty/marketing-department) at the Robert J. Trulaske Sr. College of Business, University of Missouri (MU). I am also a visiting faculty at the University of Passau, Germany. Besides, I have been an investigator on a range of industry-based research projects.

My area of specialization is data analytics and operations research with research interests in healthcare operations management, logistics, smart service systems, and supply chain management. My research has been funded by multiple federal and state agencies. In addition, I have also been an investigator for several industry-sponsored projects. I have published over 80 peer-reviewed articles in journals, conferences, and books. 

I teach undergraduate, graduate, and MBA level courses that include topics pertaining to data analytics, machine learning, simulation, service systems, and supply chain optimization. I am also an active member of INFORMS and IISE professional societies and have served numerous times as a track chair in their annual conferences. I am also a certified six sigma black belt and recipient of multiple awards (Outstanding IMSE Faculty Award, INFORMS Koopman prize, INFORMS Data Mining and Decision Analytics Best Paper Finalist, Winemiller Excellence Award, Richard Wallace Faculty Grant, Service Enterprise Engineering Fellowship).
