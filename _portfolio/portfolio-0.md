My research has evolved to span the field of big data analytics (BDA), operations research (OR), and industrial engineering (IE). In the current era of Industry 5.0, Web 2.0 and Supply Chain 4.0, the interface of data analytics with IE and OR has the potential to substantially improve business operations for faster and smarter decision-making, which, in turn, reduces costs, increases revenue, and facilitates sustainable practice. Accordingly, my research seeks to develop quantitative data-driven models/algorithms for optimizing system processes and supporting business decisions. In particular, my research has transdisciplinary application and impact in four key areas, namely, Health Care Operations Management, Preventive Health Care, Service Systems, and Transportation/Logistics. Besides, my research has received press mentions from different media outlets such as ISE Magazine, Science Trends blog, University News releases, and Twitter. My scholarly activities and contributions in the aforementioned research areas and future research plans are highlighted in the following sections.
